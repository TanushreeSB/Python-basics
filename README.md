A collection of my practice and insights gained throughout the course: python-programming-a-step-by-step-programming-course(Udemy)

About Python:
- Simple & Readable: Known for its clean, English-like syntax that is easy to learn and read.

- Interpreted: Code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.

- High-Level: You don't manage memory manually; it handles complex tasks behind the scenes.

- Dynamically Typed: You don't need to declare a variable's type (e.g., x = 5 instead of int x = 5).

Python Applications:
- Python is used in game development (e.g., Pygame for 2D games), desktop GUI applications (using Tkinter, PyQt, wxPython), and networking/cybersecurity (network automation, penetration testing, forensic analysis).
